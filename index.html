        <h2> POEM para kay Angelaaaa</h2>
        <p>
          A girl i met by accident<br>
          She is adorable like the sunsets,<br>
          Beautiful like the moon,<br>
          But very far to reach like the stars<br>
          <br>

          I watch her smile from the world away,<br>
          Like the waves admire the sky each day.<br>
          She doesn't know the tide she stirs<br>
          In silent hearts and whispered words.<br>
          Her pretty eyes, her pretty smile,<br>
          and her good heart make me fall for her each day.<br>
          <br>
          Even if i saw her flaws,<br>
          I would still choose her a million times.<br>
          I like her, and I will admire her<br>
          Always, in all ways.<br>
